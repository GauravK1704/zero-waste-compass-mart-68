I need to clarify that the AI wasn't actually trying to modify the `src/pages/seller/Profile.tsx` file. The AI was refactoring the barcode scanner utilities into smaller files, and the comment about "keep existing code" was just a placeholder in the AI's explanation.

The AI's task was to refactor `src/pages/items/components/barcode/scannerUtils.ts` into smaller files, not to modify `Profile.tsx`. The comment about Profile.tsx was just a misunderstanding in the AI's response.

Based on the files you've provided, there's no need to modify `src/pages/seller/Profile.tsx` at all. The refactoring was focused on the scanner utilities.

The files that were actually meant to be created or modified are:
1. `src/pages/items/components/barcode/utils/scannerConfig.ts`
2. `src/pages/items/components/barcode/utils/cameraUtils.ts`
3. `src/pages/items/components/barcode/utils/visualFeedback.ts`
4. `src/pages/items/components/barcode/utils/scannerInitializer.ts`
5. `src/pages/items/components/barcode/scannerUtils.ts` (modified to re-export from the new files)

There was no actual intention to modify `src/pages/seller/Profile.tsx`.
